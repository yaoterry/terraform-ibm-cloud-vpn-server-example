The terraform configuration to setup IBM Cloud VPN server will mainly use IBM Cloud terraform provider: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest.

The terraform configuration for VPN server setup needs to do the below things:
1. Create the IBM Cloud secrets manager instance with trial plan.
2. Generate the server certificate/key and client certificate/key locally, or generate the certificate/keys via private certificate capability in IBM secrets manager service.
3. Import the server/client certificate/key to secrets manager instance. For IBM secerts manager generated private certificate, please skip this step. 
4. Create one VPC and one subnet
5. Create one subnet
6. Create a security group with inbound and outbound rules to allow all traffics.
7. Create the VPN server within the subnet, security group, and server/client certificates in secerts manager instance.
8. Download the VPN client profile and configure the client certicate and key in the client profile.

Then, user can use the VPN client profile with OpenVPN client to connect the client machine to the created VPN server.


To run the terraform configuration, you can run below command with your IBM Cloud api key:

```
terraform apply --var "ibmcloud_api_key={{YOUR_IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY}}"
```
